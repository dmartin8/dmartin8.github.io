### Practices towards Continious Deployment

// TODO: resume notes+links

- Pair/mob/ensambe
- code: easy to understand/change/test
- TDD
- Parallel changes: feature toggles(gitlab toggles), bba
- Baby commits
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Traces
- Priority by product value
- Rollback
- Continuous Deployment pipeline (fast, save and automated)
- 'Lousely - coupled' and 'autonomous' teams/services (autonomy as much as possible)
- Enginering culture that supports it
